## PyBank

* We are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of our company. We are given a set of financial data called **budget_data.csv**. The dataset is composed of two columns: `Data` and `Profit/Losses`.

* Our task is to create a Python that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
	* The total number of months included in the dataset
	* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
	* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
	* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
	* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Our final script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

* We are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process, which used to be tallied one-by-one by hand.

* We are given a set of poll data called **election_data.csv**. The data set is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
	* The total number of votes cast
	* A complete list of candidates who received votes
	* The percentage of votes each candidate won
	* The total number of votes each candidate won
	* The winner of the election based on popular vote

* Our final script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
